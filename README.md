# FPV-drones detector 
#### This project made for FPV-drone detection on photos and videos. Recently, drone and computer vision technologies are being tightly integrated into people's lives. Drone detection can be useful in military applications, for example.
#### My project trained on custom dataset with +700 images of different FPV-drones. It is also based on YOLOv8 model (also YOLOv9). 
#### Project includes:
#### - Python code to drone detection on photos
#### - Python code to drone detection on videos
#### - Example of photo
#### - Example of drone detaction on photo
#### - Example of video
#### - Example of drone detaction on video
#### - File with pre-trained weights on own custom dataset.
#### Hope that you will find it interesting and usefull:)
